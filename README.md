# eye-of-providence

This app was built for the purpose of raising awareness of the current state of IoT security.

Nowadays, devices with either no preconfigured authentication or hard-coded default credentials are flooding the market. The Eye of Providence app finds Android video cameras with no authentication, and streams them within a grid. For anyone who wants to know what it feels like to be an NSA employee, *this could be it*.
